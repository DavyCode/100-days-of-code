### Real Day 1: January 3rd 2017
**Today's Progress**: Feels good starting 100DaysOfCode on my Birthday!!! I think I have enough inspiration to see this through. Tried to fix the problems with my react app involving history and react router. Finally got a patch fix working but I think since my project is still pretty new, I will just restart the project afresh tomorrow and start with cleaer code.
**Thoughts**: I think react works really well for me and I will use it for this very important project. I will encounter a lot of bugs but then that's where real learning comes from. Marching on tomorrow

### Day 2: January 4th 2017
**Today's progress**: Finally got to fix the history and react router bugs that were ruining my code. Restarted implementation of material ui in my app and created the master and app bar components already. Next up is to create the body of the landing page and make sure it routes well.
**Thoughts**: THIS WILL NOT BE EASY!!! We continue tomorrow.
