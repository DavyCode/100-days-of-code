// **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

// **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Real Day 1: January 3rd 2016
**Today's Progress**: Feels good starting 100DaysOfCode on my Birthday!!! I think I have enough inspiration to see this through. Tried to fix the problems with my react app involving history and react router. Finally got a patch fix working but I think since my project is still pretty new, I will just restart the project afresh tomorrow and start with cleaer code.
**Thoughts**: I think react works really well for me and I will use it for this very important project. I will encounter a lot of bugs but then that's where real learning comes from. Marching on tomorrow
